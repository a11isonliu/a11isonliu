### Hi, I'm Allison (she/her)!

I am a senior studying applied mathematics at the University of Colorado Boulder. I am interested in using my math and programming knowledge to solve problems in research to improve sustainability, healthcare, social justice and space science. Currently, I'm working at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP) to improve solar flare prediction using deep learning!
