### Hi, I'm Allison (she/her)!

I am a recent applied mathematics Master's graduate at the University of Colorado Boulder. I am interested in using my math and programming knowledge to solve problems in research to improve sustainability, healthcare, social justice and space science. Currently, I'm working with the Space Weather Technology and Research Center (SWxTREC) to improve solar flare prediction using deep learning!
